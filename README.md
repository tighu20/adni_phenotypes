# Data availability

The different data files used in this repository (in .csv format) can be accessed inside the folder `data/`. More explanations about each file and how to use them can be seen in the code, which in turn will be explained in the remaining of this repository.

The code to preprocess all datasets can also be accessed in this folder in the Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb` files)

# Machine learning model train and inference

## Python dependencies

The machine learning model was developed using Python, whose dependencies are contained in the file `adni_env.yml`. To install all the dependencies automatically with [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/), one can easily just run the following command in the terminal to create an Anaconda environment:

```bash
$ conda env create -f adni_env.yml
$ conda activate adni_env
```

## Running the experiments

The code in this repository relies on [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) to keep track and organise the results of experiments. We recommend that a user wanting to run and extend our code first gets familiar with the [online documentation](https://docs.wandb.com/). The main run used in the paper can be seen here: https://wandb.ai/tjiagom/adni_phenotypes/runs/2cxy59fk

The training script used in the paper is in `train.py`, with all hyperparameters hard-coded inside, the model's architecture defined in `models.py`, and data loader in `datasets.py`.

To run inference on the trained model, we used the script `inference.py`, which saves the output in the `results/` folder (given stochasticity, we provide all our outputs in this folder for reproducibility). Different flags are available; for example, the following script:

```bash
$ python inference.py --dataset_location data/adni_test_scaled_corrected.csv --dataset_id adni
```

will run infrence on the test set of the ADNI dataset using Monte Carlo dropout as described in the paper. In this case, the output of the model will be stored in `results/latest_output_adni_50.csv`.


## Remaining repository structure for ML model
- `model_statistics.py`: contains the code used to calculate averaged times to run our models as reported in the paper.
- `regress_models/`: This folder contain pickle files with the regression models used in the ADNI train set, which are needed to preprocess the ADNI test set, and the NACC/UKB datasets. The way these files are created and used can be seen in `results/Preprocessing ADNI data.ipynb`.
- `results/`: besides logging the `.csv` data files as previously explained, it also contains several Jupyter Notebooks (`*.ipynb` files) with various analysis explored in the paper.
- `saved_models/`: it contains the single pytorch model used in the paper; however, this file is overwritten every time `inference.py` is run
